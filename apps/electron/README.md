# HiDock Universal Knowledge Hub

**The fourth iteration and PRIMARY APPLICATION of HiDock Next** - A cross-platform Electron application that transforms ANY information source into actionable insights. Not just audio recordings - this is a universal knowledge extraction and management system.

## Fork Changes (zislogic/hidock-next)

This fork adds full **local/offline AI processing** support to the Electron app — transcription, analysis, and output generation all run without any cloud API dependency.

### Local Whisper Transcription
- Integrated **whisper.cpp** via `@fugood/whisper.node` for on-device speech-to-text
- Supports models: `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large-v3-turbo`, `large-v3` (default)
- Automatic model download with progress tracking in Settings
- Language selection per-recording and as a global default
- Re-transcribe button with model and language override
- **Silero VAD** (Voice Activity Detection) pre-filters silence before transcription, preventing Whisper hallucinations on quiet segments

### Fully Local AI Pipeline
- **Transcription**: Whisper (local) or Gemini (cloud) — switchable in Settings
- **Analysis** (summaries, action items, topics): Ollama when configured, falls back to Gemini
- **Chat / RAG**: Ollama local LLM with configurable model name
- **Meeting Minutes generation**: Ollama with `think: false` for compatibility with reasoning models (qwen3, DeepSeek R1, etc.)
- Ollama model name is now configurable in Settings → Chat/RAG (e.g. `qwen3.5:27b`, `llama3.2`, `mistral`)

### UX Improvements
- **Library list view** simplified: only Play and Delete buttons visible; secondary text shows date/time and duration instead of filename
- **Recording duration** fixed: removed incorrect 4× correction factor from all firmware version calculations
- **Generate Meeting Minutes** opens an inline modal directly in the Library — no page navigation required
- **Rename recordings** via the detail panel
- **Delete also removes from device** when a HiDock device is connected
- Deleted recordings no longer reappear from the device cache after deletion

### Bug Fixes
- Transcription transcript saved even when Gemini analysis fails (rate limit / no API key)
- Ollama singleton resets when Settings are saved, so model/URL changes take effect immediately without restarting
- Thinking-mode models (`qwen3`, `deepseek-r1`) no longer hang or return empty output — `think: false` disables reasoning mode for generation calls
- Non-UUID recording IDs handled correctly in delete flow

## Vision: Universal Knowledge Hub

This is the **integrated vision** that unifies all previous HiDock Next iterations (Desktop device management, Web transcription, Audio Insights analysis) into a single, powerful intelligence system. The goal is to extract data, create insights, and produce results from ANY knowledge source - not just recordings, but PDFs, presentations, documents, markdown files, notes, calendar events, emails, Slack messages, and more.

## Current Features (Wave 4 Refactor)

### Knowledge Extraction & Management
- **Device Management** - Sync recordings from HiDock H1/H1E/P1 devices (integrates Desktop app capabilities)
- **AI Transcription** - Automatic transcription with Google Gemini (integrates Web app capabilities)
- **Unified Library** - Browse and manage all recordings with advanced filtering and search (integrates Audio Insights capabilities)
- **Auto-Refresh** - Real-time detection and updates when new recordings are added
- **Waveform Visualization** - Immediate audio visualization on selection

### Intelligence & Search
- **RAG Chat** - Query your meeting transcripts using natural language
- **Vector Search** - Semantic search across all meeting content
- **Calendar Sync** - Import meetings from ICS feeds and correlate with recordings

### Future Capabilities (Universal Knowledge Hub)
- **Multi-Artifact Support** - PDFs, PPTX, DOCX, MD, notes, emails, Slack messages
- **Universal Extraction** - Extract insights from any artifact type
- **Cross-Source Insights** - Connect knowledge across different information sources
- **Document Generation** - Create minutes, feedback reports, summaries from any knowledge source
- **Enhanced Intelligence** - Multi-modal AI analysis across all artifact types

## Evolution: From Device Management to Universal Knowledge Hub

HiDock Next evolved through four iterations, each building toward the ultimate vision:

1. **Desktop App (First Iteration)** - Python/CustomTkinter application focused on HiDock device management via USB (Jensen protocol). Provided file sync, device settings, and basic audio playback.

2. **Web App (Second Iteration)** - React/TypeScript browser interface using WebUSB API. Made recordings accessible anywhere without drivers, added multi-provider AI transcription.

3. **Audio Insights (Third Iteration)** - Proof-of-concept for AI-powered audio analysis and insight extraction from transcriptions.

4. **Electron App (Fourth Iteration - Current)** - The integrated vision that combines all previous capabilities into a universal knowledge hub. Currently focused on recordings, but architected for ANY artifact type.

### What Makes This Different

This is not just an "audio app" - it's the foundation of a universal knowledge extraction system:

- **Integrated Capabilities**: Combines device management (from Desktop), transcription (from Web), and insights (from Audio Insights) in one application
- **Universal Architecture**: Designed to handle recordings NOW, but built to support ANY knowledge source (documents, notes, emails, etc.) in the future
- **Knowledge-First Approach**: Organized around insights and information, not just files
- **Cross-Source Intelligence**: Will connect knowledge across different information sources
- **Extraction Pipeline**: Extract → Chunk → Embed → Analyze → Produce Results
